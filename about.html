    <h3>What is Blancstore</h3>
    <h6>A simple website where you can download all of <a href="github.com/PyHubs">PyHubs</a> and <a
        href="https://replit.com/@IMIBUKS">IMIBUKS </a>applications and website URLS.</h6>

    <h4>Why</h4>
    <h6>There was no easy way to download all my applications back in the day, so i made blancstore! A simple websit
      were you can view all my GOOD and FINISHED websites and desktop apps</h6>

    <h4>Is this everything?</h4>
    <h6>Sadly no, there is still many lost projects, unfinished onces and ones that are not conmpiled into .exe yet. We
      are trying to upload all the FINISHED ones here as soon as we can. We are even thinking of adding an "abandoned"
      cateogory</h6>

    <h4>Why is comments not working?</h4>
    <h6>Because we have not implemented it yet, lol. We have not gone to that yet. It will probably be just
      localStorage, and will not update live</h6>
